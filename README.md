# 🎮 Pig Game 🐷🎲

I built a fun and simple two-player dice game while learning JavaScript!  
You can play the game [**here**](https://pig-game-tagore-projects.vercel.app/).

## 📝 How to Play

1. 👥 **Two Players**: The game alternates turns between two players.
2. 🎲 **Rolling the Dice**:
   - Rolling a number between 2 and 6 adds that value to the player's _current score_.
   - Rolling a **1** causes the player to lose their _current score_, and their turn ends immediately.
3. 🛑 **Hold Your Score**:
   - A player can choose to "Hold" their score at any time.
   - This adds the _current score_ to their _total score_ and switches the turn to the other player.
4. 🏆 **Winning**:
   - The first player to reach a _total score_ of **100** wins the game!
